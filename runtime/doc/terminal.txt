Terminal window support					*terminal*


WARNING: THIS IS ONLY PARTLY IMPLEMENTED, ANYTHING CAN STILL CHANGE

The terminal feature is optional, use this to check if your Vim has it: >
	echo has('terminal')
If the result is "1" you have it.


1. Basic use			|terminal-use|
2. Remote testing		|terminal-testing|
3. Debugging			|terminal-debug|

{Vi does not have any of these commands}

==============================================================================
1. Basic use						*terminal-use*

This feature is for running a terminal emulator in a Vim window.  A job can be
started connected to the terminal emulator. For example, to run a shell: >
     :term bash

Or to run a debugger: >
     :term gdb vim

The job runs asynchronously from Vim, the window will be updated to show
output from the job, also  while editing in any other window.

Typing ~

When the keyboard focus is in the terminal window, typed keys will be send to
the job.  This uses a pty when possible.  You can click outside of the
terminal window to move keyboard focus elsewhere.

Navigate between windows with CTRL-W commands.  E.g. CTRL-W CTRL-W moves focus
to the next window.  Use "CTRL-W :" to edit an Ex command.  Use "CTRL-W ." to
send a CTRL-W to the job in the terminal.

See option 'termkey' for specifying another key that precedes a Vim command.
Typing 'termkey' twice sends 'termkey' to the job.

Size ~

See option 'termsize' for controlling the size of the terminal window.
(TODO: scrolling when the terminal is larger than the window)

Syntax ~

:ter[minal] [command]				*:ter* *:terminal*
			Open a new terminal window.

			If [command] is provided run it as a job and connect
			the input and output to the terminal.
			If [command] is not given the 'shell' option is used.

			A new buffer will be created, using [command] or
			'shell' as the name.  If a buffer by this name already
			exists a number is added in parenthesis.
			E.g. if "gdb" exists the second terminal buffer will
			use "gdb (1)".

			The window can be closed, in which case the buffer
			becomes hidden.  The command will not be stopped.  The
			`:buffer` command can be used to turn the current
			window into a terminal window, using the existing
			buffer.  If there are unsaved changes this fails, use
			! to force, as usual.

When the buffer associated with the terminal is wiped out the job is killed,
similar to calling `job_stop(job, "kill")`


Resizing ~

The size of the terminal can be in one of three modes:

1. The 'termsize' option is empty: The terminal size follows the window size.
   The minimal size is 2 screen lines with 10 cells.

2. The 'termsize' option is "rows*cols", where "rows" is the minimal number of
   screen rows and "cols" is the minimal number of cells.

3. The 'termsize' option is "rowsXcols" (where the x is upper or lower case).
   The terminal size is fixed to the specified number of screen lines and
   cells.  If the window is bigger there will be unused empty space.

If the window is smaller than the terminal size, only part of the terminal can
be seen (the lower-left part).

The |term_getsize()| function can be used to get the current size of the
terminal.  |term_setsize()| can be used only when in the first or second mode,
not when 'termsize' is "rowsXcols".


Unix ~

On Unix a pty is used to make it possible to run all kinds of commands.  You
can even run Vim in the terminal!  That's used for debugging, see below.


MS-Windows ~

On MS-Windows winpty is used to make it possible to run all kind of commands.
Obviously, they must be commands that run in a terminal, not open their own
window.

You need the following two files from winpty:

    winpty.dll
    winpty-agent.exe

You can download them from the following page:

    https://github.com/rprichard/winpty

Just put the files somewhere in your PATH.

==============================================================================
2. Remote testing					*terminal-testing*

Most Vim tests execute a script inside Vim.  For some tests this does not
work, running the test interferes with the code being tested.  To avoid this
Vim is executed in a terminal window.  The test sends keystrokes to it and
inspects the resulting screen state.

Functions ~

term_sendkeys()		send keystrokes to a terminal
term_wait()		wait for screen to be updated
term_scrape()		inspect terminal screen


==============================================================================
3. Debugging					*terminal-debug*

The Terminal debugging plugin can be used to debug a program with gdb and view
the source code in a Vim window. For example: >

	:TermDebug vim

This opens three windows:
- A terminal window in which "gdb vim" is executed.  Here you can directly
  interact with gdb.
- A terminal window for the executed program.  When "run" is used in gdb the
  program I/O will happen in this window, so that it does not interfere with
  controlling gdb.
- A normal Vim window used to show the source code.  When gdb jumps to a
  source file location this window will display the code, if possible.  Values
  of variables can be inspected, breakpoints set and cleared, etc.

This uses two terminal windows.  To open the gdb window: >
	:term gdb [arguments]
To open the terminal to run the tested program |term_open()| is used.
